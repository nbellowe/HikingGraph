Plan for “trailsy”:
	First gather the path-segments of the trails. 
	Take these path-segments and the trailhead’s longitude/latitude.
		Determine each vertex in the path-segment’s longitude and latitude
		Take this longitude and latitude, and query external api for elevation (server side, once, just making a database for later).
	Then, traverse each trail and graph the elevation gain over length traveled along path.
	Generate graph with the canvas? Or maybe something better. 
	Cache these graphs server-side


Path: XY[];
run this database through PathToPathAndElevation(XY[] xyArr, XYElevation[] worldMap) XYElevation[]

Foreach path in paths:
	Foreach point in path:
		Graph points z coordinate.


https://maps.googleapis.com/maps/api/elevation/json?locations=39.9440287,-105.2901363&key=AIzaSyCNXMjRj14ZmYDOT-EFjwebvSMHua6Ww6A

TODO: 
	Get path data for all trails displayable.
	Run that path data through a program to get the elevation.
	Run that output through a program to generate charts for each path’s elevation change.
	Devise a system to display these graphs client-side.
